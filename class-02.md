## jQuery :

### What is jQuery?
**jQuery** is a **JavaScript** library tjet we can use it in **javaScript** file to access and manuplate **html** elemnts ans their **CSS**, using **jQuery** methods.
### Why jQuery?
The purpose of **jQuery** is to make it much easier to use **JavaScript** on our website.
jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.
jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like the manipulation of **DOM**.

### Syntax of jQuery:
the basic syntax of jQuery is: $(selector).action()

- A ``$`` sign is to define and access **jQuery**.
- A ``(selector)`` to find (it can be tage name or id or ...etc) HTML elements.
- A jQuery ``action()`` to be performed on the elements;

**for exampel :** ``$("p").hide() - hides all <p> elements.``

### jQuery Selectors:
jQuery selectors allow you to select and manipulate HTML element(s).
jQuery selectors are used to "find"  **HTML** elements based on their name, id, classes, types, attributes , etc... 

>>**notes:**
All selectors in jQuery start with the dollar sign and parentheses: ``$()``.

jQuery uses CSS syntax to select elements

### Some of jQuery Event Methods:
- The ``$(document).ready()`` method allows us to execute a function when the document is fully loaded.
- The ``click()`` method attaches an event handler function to an HTML element.
- The ``dblclick()`` method attaches an event handler function to an HTML element.
- The ``mouseenter()`` method attaches an event handler function to an HTML element.
and much more.

### Some of jQuery Effects Methods:
- ``hide()`` and ``show()`` methods: used to hide and show **HTML** elements.
- ``toggle()`` method: used to toggle between hiding and showing an **HTML** elements.
- ``fadeIn()`` method is used to fade in a hidden **HTML** element.
- ``fadeOut()`` method is used to fade out a visible element.
and much more.

### jQuery DOM Manipulation:
jQuery comes with a bunch of DOM related methods that make it easy to access and manipulate elements and attributes.
 1.  we use  ``text()``, ``html()``, and ``val()`` to get and set Content of **html**.
 - ``text()`` - Sets or returns the text content of selected elements
 - ``html()`` - Sets or returns the content of selected elements 
 - ``val()``  - Sets or returns the value of form fields
 2.  we use ``attr()`` to get Attributes.
 3.  we use ``append()`` , ``prepend()``, ``after()`` and ``before()`` to add content to the **html**
-  ``append()`` - Inserts content at the end of the selected elements
-  ``prepend()`` - Inserts content at the beginning of the selected elements
-  ``after()`` - Inserts content after the selected elements
-  ``before()`` - Inserts content before the selected elements
4.  we use `empty()` and ``remove()`` to remove element and content of **html**
-  ``remove()`` - Removes the selected element (and its child elements)
-  ``empty()`` - Removes the child elements from the selected element

- the Navigator: the programmer whose give the directions and the instructions and doesn't inter direct code.

**Advantages of Pair Programming:**
- thiere are many advantages, like:
- inshort the time of coding.
- the experience exchang between both of programmer.
