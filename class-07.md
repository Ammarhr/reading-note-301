## build a good teame:

The measure that determines the success of the teams, is not the amount of intelligence and leadership of individuals, on the contrary, this matter may be one of the obstacles to the success of the team. Conflict of ideas and struggle for leadership have caused problems in the team, and average individuals may be neutralized from any support they might give to the team. The most important thing for the team is the spirit of cooperation between individuals, and contribute in an equal manner by presenting ideas and sharing them. This will result in the maximum benefit from all the strengths of the team members, and this will give a wider scope for success in the tasks presented to the teams.

## HTTP:
**http** stand for (hyber text transfer protocol). **http** is the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser. **http** tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing, Because it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”.   A web page is a “representation” of a resource

## URL : 
**url** stand for (universal Resource Locator), it is those things that you type into the browser. **URLs** tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept.

## RESST:
 **REST**  stand for (Representational State Transfer). **REST** is a way for two computer systems to communicate over HTTP in a similar way to web browsers and servers.

 ### Creating a RESTful Web Service
A **RESTful** web service request contains:
1. **AN Endpoint URL**. An application implementing a RESTful API will define one or more URL endpoints with a domain, port, path, and/or querystring.

2. **The HTTP method**. Differing HTTP methods can be used on any endpoint which map to application create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations:

--------------------------------------------------
|__**HTTP method**__  | __CRUD__ | __**Action**__|
| --------------------| -------- | -------------:|
|   GET	            | read	   | returns requested data    |
|  POST	            | create   | creates a new record      |
| PUT or PATCH        | update   | updates an existing record|
|   DELETE            | delete   | deletes an existing record|

3. **HTTP headers.** Information such as authentication tokens or cookies can be contained in the HTTP request header.

4. **Body Data:** Data is normally transmitted in the HTTP body in an identical way to HTML <form> submissions or by sending a single JSON-encoded data string.

### The Response:
The response payload can be whatever is practical: data, HTML, an image, an audio file, and so on. Data responses are typically JSON-encoded, but XML, CSV, simple strings, or any other format can be used.
